# labyrintJava
A program written in Java that can find all the possible exit-routes from a location the user chooses. Written in mainly Norwegian
It's a GUI written with help of the swing java library, this was a small simple uni project
## How to use
the .in files are a representation of a labirynth for the program to read and make it into a visual GUI.

Run Hovedprogram.java choose one of the .in files, recommend choosing 4.in, after you have choosen, the program will read the file and make the labirynth visually with buttons, the white/greyish buttons represent the areas that you can walk on, while the black ones are walls. Once you click on a white button it will find all the possible routes to exit and show them to you. You can click in between routes on the button, the yellow button on the bottom menu represents the shortest route.
